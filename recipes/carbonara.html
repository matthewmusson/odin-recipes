    <h2> Ingredients </h2> 

    <ul> 
        <li> 2 teaspoons olive oil</li>

        <li>1 pound guanciale (cured pork cheek), diced</li>
            
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li> 
            
        <li>3 large eggs</li>  
            
        <li>10 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese, divided</li>
            
        <li> salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Directions </h2>
    
    <ol> 
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; add guanciale. Cook, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and crispy, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 9 minutes. Drain and return to the pot. Let cool, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.
        <br>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Whisk eggs, 1/2 of the Pecorino Romano cheese, and some black pepper in a bowl until smooth and creamy.
        <br>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour egg mixture over pasta, stirring quickly, until creamy and slightly cooled. Stir in guanciale.
        <br>
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> Top with remaining Pecorino Romano cheese and more black pepper.
